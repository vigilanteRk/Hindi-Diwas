                        story, the

                                first

                        <em><b>Soz-e-Watan</b></em>. The collection, which was later banned, contained four stories
                        which sought to
                        inspire the
                        Indians in their struggle for political freedom.</li>
                    <li><strong>1909</strong> - Premchand was transferred to Mahoba, and later posted to Hamirpur as
                        the
                        Sub-deputy Inspector of Schools. Around this time, <em><b>Soz-e-Watan</b></em> was noticed by
                        the British
                        Government
                        officials, who banned it as a seditious work. The British collector of the Hamirpur District
                        ordered a
                        raid on Premchand's house, where around five hundred copies of <em><b>Soz-e-Watan</b></em> were
                        burnt,
                        After
                        this,
                        Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine <em><b>Zamana</b></em>, who had
                        published Dhanpat
                        Rai's first
                        story <em><b>Duniya Ka Sabse Anmol Ratan
                        </em></b> advised the pseudonym "Premchand". Dhanpat Rai stopped
                        using the
                        name
                        "Nawab Rai" and became Premchand.</li>
                    <li><strong>1914</strong> - Munshi Premchand started writing in Hindi. By this time, he was already
                        reputed
                        as a fiction writer in Urdu. Sumit Sarkar notes that the switch was prompted by the difficulty
                        of
                        finding publishers in Urdu.</li>
                    <li><strong>1915-1917</strong> - <em><b>His first Hindi story Saut</b></em> was published in the
                        magazine Saraswati

                        December 1915, and his <em><b>first short story collection Sapta, Saroj</b></em> was published
                        in June 1917, in

                        Buddhi Lal,
                        who allowed him to borrow novels for reading, in exchange for selling exam cram books at the
                        school. Premchand was an enthusiastic reader of classics in other languages, and translated
                        several
                        of these works in Hindi.

                        pages each and
                        obtained
                        a BA degree from Allahabad. Premchand's <em><b>first major novel Seva Sadan</b></em> was
                        published in
                        Hindi.
                        The novel
                        was originally written in Urdu under the title Bazaar-e-Husn, but was published in Hindi first
                        by a
                        Calcutta-based publisher, who offered Premchand ₹ 450 for his work. The Urdu Publisher of
                        Lahore
                        published the novel later in 1924, paying Premchand ₹ 250. The novel tells the story of an
                        unhappy
                        housewife, who first becomes a courtesan, and then manages an orphanage for the young daughters
                        of the
                        courtesans. It was well received by the critics, and helped Premchand gain wider recognition.</li>
                    <li><strong>1921</strong> - He had been promoted to Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February
                        1921, he
                        attended a meeting in Gorakhpur, where <em><b>Mahatma Gandhi</b></em> asked people to resign
                        from government
                        jobs as
                        part of the non-cooperation movement. Premchand, although physically unwell and with two kids
                        and a
                        pregnant wife to support, thought about it for 5 days and decided, with the consent of his
                        wife, to
                        resign from his government job, After quitting his job, Premchand left Gorakhpur for Benares on
                        18
                        March 1921, and decided to focus on his literary career</li>
                    <li><strong>1923</strong> - He established a printing press and publishing house in Benares,
                        christened <em><b>"Saraswati Press"</b></em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>1924</strong> - The year 1924 saw the publication of Premchand's <em><b>Rangabhumi</b></em>,
                        which has
                        a blind beggar called Surdas as its tragic hero. Schulz mentions that in <em><b>Rangabhumi</b></em>,
                        Premchand
                        comes across as a "superb social chronicler", and although the novel contains some "structural
                        flaws" and "too many authorial explanations", it shows a "marked progress" in Premchand's
                        writing style.</li>
                    <li><strong>1925-1927</strong> - <b><em>Nirmala</em>(1925) and <em>Pratigya</em></b> (1927) that
                        Premchand
                        found his way to
                        "a balanced, realistic level" that surpasses his earlier works and manages to "hold his readers
                        in tutelage". <em><b>Nirmala</b></em>, a novel dealing with the dowry system in India, was
                        first
                        serialised in
                        the magazine Chand between November 1925 and November 1926, before being published as a novel.
                        <em><b>Pratigya</b></em> ("The Vow") dealt with the subject of widow remarriage.</li>
                    <li><strong>1928</strong> - Premchand's novel <em><b>Gaban</b></em> ("Embezzlement"), focusing on
                        the
                        middle class'
                        greed, was published. In March 1930, Premchand launched a literary-political weekly magazine
                        titled <em>Hans</em>, aimed at inspiring the Indians to mobilise against the British rule. The
                        magazine,
                        noted for its politically provocative views, failed to make a profit. Premchand then took over
                        and edited another magazine called <em>Jagaran</em>, which too ran at a loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>1932</strong> - He published another novel titled <em><b>Karmabhumi</b></em>. He
                        briefly
                        served as the headmaster of the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a local school. After the school's closure,
                        he became the editor of the Madhuri magazine in Lucknow.</li>
                    <li><strong>1934</strong> - Premchand arrived in Bombay on 31 May 1934 to try his luck in the Hindi
                        film industry. He had <em><b>accepted a script writing job</b></em> for the production house
                        Ajanta Cinetone,
                        hoping that the yearly salary of ₹ 8000 would help him overcome his financial troubles. He
                        stayed in <em><b>Dadar</b></em>, and wrote the script for the film <em>Mazdoor</em> ("The
                        Labourer"). The film,
                        directed
                        by Mohan Bhawnani, depicted the poor conditions on the labour class. Premchand himself did a
                        cameo as the leader of labourers in the film.</li>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong> - Premchand's <em><b>"Saraswati Press"</b></em> was under a heavy debt of
                        ₹ 4000, and
                        Premchand was forced to discontinue the publication of Jagaran. Meanwhile, Premchand
                        was
                        beginning to dislike the non-literary commercial environment of the Bombay film
                        industry, and
                        wanted to return to Benares. However, he had signed a one-year contract with the
                        production
                        house. He ultimately left Bombay on 4 April 1935, before the completion of one year.
                        Himanshu
                        Roy, the founder of Bombay Talkies, tried to convince Premchand to stay back, but did

                    <li><strong>1936</strong> - After leaving Bombay, Premchand wanted to settle in Allahabad, where
                        <em><b>his sons Sripat Rai and Amrit kumar Rai</b></em> were studying. He also planned to
                        publish <em><b>Hans</b></em> from
                        there. However, owing to his financial situation and ill-health, he had to hand over Hans to
                        the Indian Literary Counsel and move to Benares <br>
                        <em><b>Godaan upanyas</b></em> (The Gift of a Cow, 1936), <em><b>Premchand's last completed
                                work</b></em>, is generally
                        accepted as <em><b>his best novel</b></em>, and is considered as one of the <em><b>finest Hindi
                                novels</b></em>. The
                        protagonist, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige
                        in rural India. According to Schulz, "Godan is a well-structured and well-balanced novel which
                        amply fulfills the literary requirements postulated by the Western literary standards."
                        Unlike other contemporary renowned authors such as <em><b>Rabindranath Tagore</b></em>, <em><b>Premchand</b></em>
                        was not
                        appreciated much outside India. <em><b>Siegfried Schulz</b></em> believes that the reason for
                        this was absence
                        of good translations of his work. Also, unlike <em>Tagore</em> and <em>Iqbal</em>, <em>Premchand</em>
                        never travelled
                        outside India, studied abroad or mingled with the renowned foreign literary figures. <br>
                        <b>In 1936</b>, Premchand also published <em><b>Kafaan </b></em>("Shroud"), in which a poor man
                        collects
                        money for the
                        funeral rites of his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink. <em><b>Premchand's last
                                published
                                story was Cricket Matching</em></b>, which appeared in <em><b>Zamana</b></em> in 1938,
                        after
                        his death. <br>
                        <em><b>He died on 8 October 1936, after several days of sickness and while
                                still in office</b></em>. <br>
                        <em><b>Premchand was elected as the first President of the Progressive Writers' Association in
                                Lucknow, in 1936.</b></em></li>
